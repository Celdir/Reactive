# Reactive

A digital platform for live-action gaming.

Developed at TAMUHack 2015. Made with love and crayons.

Divided into three main parts.

1. Game Server - Hosts live games.

2. Leaderboard Server - Interfaces with Cassandra and stores state.

3. Web Server - Serves the website itself.

Code should be put into directories appropriately.
