# Reactive

A digital platform for live-action gaming.

Developed at TAMUHack 2015. Made with love and crayons.

Divided into three main parts.

1. Game Server - Hosts live games.

2. Leaderboard Server - Interfaces with Cassandra and stores state.

3. Web Server -  Literally static files and Javascript.

Code should be put into directories appropriately.

We make no promises about quality, nor effectiveness. Twas a good run.

Requires Flask to function, using a wonderful web template from [TEMPLATED](http://templated.co).

Thanks and Gig 'Em!
